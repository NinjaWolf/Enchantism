Enchantism
==========

###Overview

A potential solution to the balancing of enchantments on Survival.

Enchantism will allow the user to select the enchantments they want, while staying in a vanilla environment (GUI, not commands).

###Current Features

* Fancy GUI (now dynamic, not hard-coded)
* Fully customisable level costs, enabling and disabling of enchants.
* Works and will work with any enchantable item and any enchantment.

###Screenshots

Nothing selectable when there isn't an enchantable tool in the slot:
